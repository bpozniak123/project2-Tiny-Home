Unit 2: Full Stack Development

Tiny Home Application Project 2 Read Me:

Techniques Utilized:
JavaScript, HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, Atlas, and Heroku


App Setup: Provide examples and information around tiny home, school bus conversions, and van conversion tiny homes. 

User Story: User has the ability to view landing page and can choose amongst 3 different options and models to view (traditional tiny homes, school bus/ "schoolies", and van homes). When the user clicks on the "See ' ' Models" button for any of the 3 types of homes, it will re-direct the user to that specific model's index page to view 3 examples of that specific model. For example, if the user clicks on "See Tiny Home Models" button from the homepage, it will take the user to the Tiny Home index with the ability to see 3 examples/styles of Tiny Homes.

From a specific model's index page, the user will be able to view a picture of each example (3 examples for each model), be able to click on the title or style of each model to re-direct to that style's show page. The user will also be able to click on a yellow 'Edit' button or red 'Delete' button to edit a model to fit their desired specs/budget or delete a model from the page. 

The user also has the ability to return to the homepage or create a new model of their own by clicking on the hyperlink that matches each option in the upper left-hand corner of the webpage. 

Updates to be Made:
Continue to add more styling, a menu bar on the homepage, and add more detail under each model's show page. 
Need to include a package to allow the user to upload their own tiny home, school bus conversion, and/or van. 
Also, would like to incorporate Google Maps to allow users to find national parks or campsites.
Lastly, I'd like to possibly include a way for users to construct their own floorplan or choose a floorplan and build a model from start to finish.
